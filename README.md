## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose installed
- (Optional) Google Programmable Search API credentials

### Installation Steps

**1. Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd Osint
```

**2. Environment Variables Setup:**

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your credentials:

```bash
# Linux/Mac
cp .env.example .env

# Windows
copy .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and change the values:

```env
# Google Custom Search Engine (optional)
GOOGLE_CSE_API_KEY=your_google_cse_api_key_here
GOOGLE_CSE_CX=your_google_cse_cx_here

# SearXNG Secret (change to a random string)
SEARXNG_SECRET_KEY=change_this_to_a_random_string
# SearXNG Base URL (used by Orchestrator when calling the JSON API)
SEARXNG_BASE_URL=http://searxng:8080

# OpenSearch Password (change to a strong password)
OPENSEARCH_INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD=change_this_to_a_strong_password

# The rest can remain as they are
```

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Don't commit the `.env` file! It's already in `.gitignore` for your security.

> 💡 If you don't set the Google CSE credentials, the `/search` endpoint will work with limited capabilities (SearXNG only).

**3. Start the stack:**
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Wait until all services are up (~2-3 minutes for the first time).

## 💡 Usage Examples

### 🎯 Orchestrate — Full OSINT Workflow (Recommended)

The `/orchestrate` endpoint is the most powerful feature, combining all services in a multi-step workflow:

**Fields:** `name`, `keywords`, `phone` (optional), limits...

**Behavior:**
- Runs initial web search, extracts emails & usernames, runs social lookups and email checks, performs hybrid search (BM25+kNN), ingests URLs, and exports CSV for Maltego.
- **Phone handling:** If `phone` is NOT provided, the system will NOT include it in the initial search. Instead, it attempts to discover phone numbers from initial results (snippets/titles/URLs) and, if found, uses them downstream (PhoneInfoga & hybrid query), limited by `phone_limit`.

**Params (limits):**
- `search_limit`, `social_limit`, `email_limit`, `hybrid_k`, `ingest_limit`, `export_limit`
- `phone_limit` (how many discovered phones to use when `phone` is not provided)

**Example:**

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/orchestrate" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "keywords": ["athens", "security"],
    "search_limit": 15,
    "social_limit": 10,
    "email_limit": 20,
    "phone_limit": 5,
    "hybrid_k": 20,
    "ingest_limit": 60,
    "export_limit": 2000
  }'
```

**With phone number:**

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/orchestrate" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "keywords": ["athens", "security"],
    "phone": "+3069XXXXXXXX",
    "search_limit": 15,
    "social_limit": 10,
    "email_limit": 20,
    "phone_limit": 5,
    "hybrid_k": 20,
    "ingest_limit": 60,
    "export_limit": 2000
  }'
```

**Response includes:**
- `counts`: Statistics on discovered entities (URLs, emails, usernames, phones)
- `samples`: Preview of discovered entities
- `phones_found`: List of discovered phone numbers (if phone not provided)
- `phones_considered`: Phones used for downstream enrichment
- `phoneinfoga`: PhoneInfoga results for each phone
- `social`: Social media profile lookups
- `emails`: Email verification results
- `ingested`: URLs successfully indexed in OpenSearch
- `csv_path`: Path to exported CSV for Maltego

## ⚡ Performance & Tips

### General Guidelines

- **Not everything is needed every time** — Combine `/search` + `/social_lookup` for most cases
- **Social lookup doesn't burn quotas** — But it runs many checks, so use timeouts if automating
- **Email precision** — Always pass candidate emails through `/verify_email` before considering them valid

### For Scaling/Speed

If you want to invest in `/ingest_urls` + `/search_hybrid`:

**1. Batch Size Optimization:**
```bash
# Optimal: 50-200 URLs per batch
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/ingest_urls" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"urls":[/* 50-200 URLs */],"source":"batch"}'
```

**2. Embedding Configuration:**
```bash
# In orchestrator/.env or environment:
EMBED_DIM=384  # For balance between speed/quality
# EMBED_DIM=768  # If you have RAM and want better accuracy
```

**3. Docker Resources:**
```yaml
# In docker-compose.yml:
services:
  orchestrator:
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          memory: 4G  # Minimum for embeddings
  opensearch:
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          memory: 2G  # For k-NN vectors
```

**Total recommended RAM:** 4-6GB for the entire stack

### Quota Control

**Caching for Google CSE** (reduce API calls):
```bash
# Redis is already in the stack - enable caching:
# In orchestrator/main.py, add TTL 7-30 days for search results
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Same query → instant response from cache
- ✅ Reduce Google CSE quota usage by ~60-80%
- ✅ Faster response times
